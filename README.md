# pvr.stalker
Add-on for Kodi 20.0-ALPHA1, Compiled for LG webOS

Important! It is not installed by Kodi via .ZIP as usual, but must be copied manually to TV.

Unzip the pvr.stalker.zip and copy the folder pvr.stalker to `/media/developer/apps/usr/palm/applications/org.xbmc.kodi/addons/` on the TV using FileZilla.

Have fun with it.
